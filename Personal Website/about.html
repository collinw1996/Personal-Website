    <p class="text">To whom it may concern,<br/>
      I heard about this internship from Towson University’s job site.  Please find my resume that I have submitted as application for the 2017 summer intern position. I am currently a junior at Towson University where I am pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in software engineering.
      I have taken seven different computer programming courses throughout my time at Towson University. The first course was programming in the C++ language. The second course I took taught me basic programming in the Java language. The third course was built upon what I learned in the second course and we are continuing to use the Java language in this class. The fourth course I took builds upon everything I’ve learned and applies it to the real world by using and analyzing algorithms. The fifth course I took used everything I’ve learned in the past and applies it to a real world situation with a real customer and working on a real project in large team. The sixth course I took taught me basic x86 assembly code machine language. The seventh course I took taught me how to build a fully functioning website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and PHP and a MySQL database for the backend.
      I am a motivated individual who enjoys solving problems and have good communication skills.
      I have submitted my resume as well with a list of my experience, work history, and accomplishments. Thank you for your time and consideration while reviewing my application.<br/>
      <br/>
      Sincerely,<br/>
      Collin Woodruff
