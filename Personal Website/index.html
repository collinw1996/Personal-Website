    My name is Collin Woodruff and I’m a Computer Science
    major with a software engineering track at Towson University. I am
    currently a junior in my second semester with plans on graduating
    in May of 2018.<br/>
    <br/>
    During my time at Towson University I have taken many different
    programming classes and computer science courses. During my freshman
    year I took two introductory programming courses one covered the C++
    programming language and the other one covered Java. After taking these
    two classes I had developed a passion for programming and continued
    to pursue computer science my sophomore year. I took two more
    programming classes during my sophomore year and during the fall I
    learned more advanced level of the Java programming language and
    during the spring I learned about different sorting algorithms,
    trees, and graph theory that could be implemented into any object
    oriented programming language. These two classes only made me more
    intrigued to learn more about Java, C++, and many other programming
    languages so during the summer I did some independent research to
    help teach myself other programming languages. During the fall
    semester of my junior year I took three programming classes which
    all focused on a different aspect of programming. In my web development
    course we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and MySQL to develop
    our own websites. In my software engineering course we learned how to
    work in a team of 10 with a real customer for the product we were
    producing. Our product was to produce a website using the Ruby on
    Rails framework that would enable people to make an account and volunteer
    for various different events. In my principles of computer architecture
    class we learned the fundamentals of how a computer works and also learned
    how to use x86 assembly language. During this semester I am taking two programming
    classes. In database management systems we will be using SQL to develop our own
    database. In operating systems we will be using the C programming language to
    develop our own operating system.<br/>
    <br/>
    A little about me as a person is that I love to be around people and I’m easy
    to get along with. I enjoy playing soccer or any other sports with friends
    when the weather is nice or hanging out and socializing. I also enjoy playing
    video games during free time or working on a personal project while listening
    to music. I am a hardworking and passionate individual who is also competitive
    which contributes to my love for sports and video games.
